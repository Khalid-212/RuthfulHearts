## Our Core Principles:

1. **Anonymous Donations:** Charity is about selflessly helping others, without seeking recognition or praise. That's why we keep the identities of our donors private. Whether you contribute through traditional payment methods or the latest crypto options, your generosity remains anonymous and deeply appreciated. üë§

2. **For All Kinds of People:** At Ruthful Hearts, we value every human life, regardless of background or circumstance. We stand against discrimination in all its forms, because we believe that everyone deserves compassion and support. We're here to offer a helping hand, because everyone deserves a chance to start anew and thrive! ü§ù

4. **One at a Time:** Change doesn't happen overnight, but with each fundraising campaign, we're making a difference. By pooling our resources and focusing on one individual at a time, we're able to create real and lasting impact. From providing essential support to life-changing opportunities, we're dedicated to transforming lives for the better. ‚è≥

5. **Private and Graceful:** Respect, dignity, and privacy are at the heart of everything we do. We understand the importance of safeguarding personal information and preserving the anonymity of those we help. That's why we maintain strict confidentiality within the Ruthful community, ensuring that each individual's journey is treated with the utmost care and respect. ‚ú®
